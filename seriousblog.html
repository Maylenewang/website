<h2><em>Memory Tricks</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>10/20/2016</em></p>
<div class="blogtext">
<p>I have been often told that I have a great memory. I also often hear people telling me that they have a terrible memory. It is never followed with a plan for how to get memory to work for them but rather as an excuse. My memory is probably only slightly above average, but the emphasis I put towards remembering important things makes it seem like it is exceptional. I taught myself how to remember things very well when I was younger, a product of elementary school boredom. 
<p>I was told that my memory is like my mother’s, she can see something once and remember it clearly. My dad’s memory, however, is spotty at best. I saw this to be true for the most part. However I also noticed that my mother frequently cannot remember people’s names or the end of her sentences, but my dad can remember high school and university level mathematics down to the tricks and finicky rules. It is true that some people have better memory than others, but it is not the end of the story. 
<h3>Step 1: find your memory holes</h3>
<p>I have a terrible time remembering names. I would give everybody a new name if it was socially acceptable (some of my friends let me do this however). I struggle with important phone numbers. I jumble up 7 and 3, 6 and 4, and to a lesser extent 8 and 2. If I change my mind in the middle of an experiment, I will forget what I changed my mind to, or how many times I changed my mind. I forget how many flights of stairs I climbed or how many points I won in a game. Lastly, I have a particular blind spot to random phrases in another language. I can forget a phrase I heard just 15 seconds prior.  
<h3>Step 2: find your learning style</h3>
<p>You probably heard a lot of oversimplified presentations about your learning style: visual, auditory, or sensory learning. You also probably fall into the “visual category” and high five every single other person in the room. 
<p>You can probably see what I am getting at, but everybody has a picture of their friends in their heads, everybody can remember the voices of their loved ones, and everybody can remember the feeling of doing an activity. Everybody is very quick to jump on the visual category and we are told that 70% of us are visual learners – but I tend to never meet someone of the different learning style. Moreover, a lifetime of reading piloting books will never make you a pilot until you get to know a real cockpit and a real flight. So what is your actual learning style?
<p>I can remember directions I have walked and I am able to retrace my steps very well. I can memorize a piece on the piano but when I try to play on a different piano I mess up because my fingers remember the spacing between the keys of the piano I learned with. I can remember conversations, phrases, paragraphs, extravagant eyelashes, awkward stances, and textures of objects. I can recreate reality on a paper by imagining I am taking a photograph and printing it out. I can draw something from my mind by imagining it is in infront of me. I know all the wrinkles on my own hands because I use them as models all the time to the point I just remember how to do it. 
<p>I started trying to memorize things by remembering the dialogues in my favorite movies – I did it by transforming it from a long sequence of random events to a progression of emotions. I memorized songs, especially rap songs, by piecing it together by chunks and remembering what each chunk was about. I remembered miscellaneous keywords for my programming exams by comparing different computer structures to real life systems. I made connections between microbiology and large scale factories. I associate people’s names to their temperament, to how they say their own name, to who was around them, to where their names originate from, to the way they “look like” their names. I summarize conversations I have with people and remember what they were about – memorizing the content of the conversation came naturally after that. 
<p>Based on my experiences and how I learn, I would say that I am a sensory learner, needing to relate everything new to something I already know in order to remove it from abstraction. In that way most classes in school fail to give me enough time to process new material (I could pre-read to solve that problem). 
<h3>Step 3: memorize something you want to remember</h3>
<p>This isn’t a chore, this isn’t memorizing a long string of numbers at the expense of enjoying the sun and the breeze. This is like learning how to sing, how else than singing your favorite songs? 
<p>The past two days I decided to finally start memorizing Rap God by Eminem. I knew I could do it considering the number of songs in my brain’s library, but I was afraid of it because it had three times the usual number of lyrics. The first thing I did was to pull up the lyrics online so I know all the right words. I read through them all and it was very abstract by itself. I listened to the song a dozen times with the lyrics. I mouthed along as it went along. I stood up and listened to the song without the lyrics and kept forgetting what happened next. The rap song is divided into stories 2 to 5 lines long. I had to remember what each story was, and in which order. Then I can remember the story in chunks. Learning in chunks is not that useful though, because my most common choke point in piano was the transition between contrasting phrases. I painstakingly recited each verse from the start after getting to know it, “12 days of Christmas” style. 
<p>Of course what I do is pure memorization. There are other ways to remember things that actually have more to do with learning than memorizing. There was a scene in the Harry Potter books after Hermione punched Draco in the face and Ron told everybody to shut up for a few seconds. He needed to take time to solidify the memory in his mind. Singling moments like this and taking a few extra seconds to remember the exact feelings and environment actually helped me remember key things in my life. 
<h3>Step 4: build habits that help you remember important things</h3>
<p>After a lot of practice, you will end up with a toolbox of useful memorization tactics that you can use to tackle any important thing you set out to remember. For instance, some people find it useful to associate sequences of events with a room that they are familiar with. They will walk inside and see their dresser and that is associated with the first speech point, they will lift the hairbrush and attached to it is their first argument, and so on. A funny example is in “The Office” when Michael struggled to remember one line Janet wanted him to remember for the trial, he proceeded to associate every word in the sentence to a random nonsensical sentence – which worked, surprisingly. 
<p>At first, the multiplication tables looks terrifying to a second grader. But after getting familiar with them, using them all the time, and looking for patterns to make it easier, most of us have reached a stage where 7 times 4 doesn’t require more than a few seconds to compute. The same goes with exercising memory or learning.

<h2><em>Quick Book Reviews</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>11/15/2016</em></p>
<div class="blogtext">
<p>
<h1>Review of my favorite books </h1>
<p>
<h2>Stephen Fry’s “The Liar”</h2>
<p>Start with an ambiance, an interesting fact, and then watch somebody choke on their own blood. Follow Adrian Heeley, Oscar Wilde wannabe, through a profanity laden life of infatuation, betrayal, and an incredible series of events that will blow your mind. My favorite book of all time. Despite the theme of British humor it was an astounding amount of passion in my grey, grey world. 
<p>See also: The Star’s Tennis Balls, Moab is my Washpot (autobiography), and pretty much all of his other books. 
<h2>Jonathan Safran Foer’s “Everything is Illuminated”</h2>
<p>A work of art. I couldn’t believe the book was even real at times, it was crazy and too beautiful to be a part of my life. I had to look up the author to figure out how he knew so much about the subject matter and also how much of it was fact. I didn’t know you could write an entire chapter without punctuation, in all caps lock, as one long sentence connected by “and”, or with words written over each until you couldn’t read anything. I didn’t know you could write about such taboo things. I didn’t know you could care for a character that was perfect in every way. I didn’t know how a book could be so many books in one and with so many stories that I can’t even tell you what the story is about. 
<p>It is also an amazing film starring Elijah Wood and Eugene Hutz (of no other than GOGOL BORDELLO!!!). The film introduced me to several amazing genres (Gypsy punk, Klezmer, eastern european folk). The sunflower scene blew my mind, I won’t tell you why because you have to watch it. This is the first movie I ever thought was beautiful. 
<p>Also read every other book he wrote, including “Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close”. If you can figure out “Tree of Codes” please let me know how. He just published a new book “Here I am” which I no doubt will get my hands on. 
<h2>James Shreeve’s “The Genome War”</h2>
<p>If you read boring lecture slides about the genome war and don’t understand why it is so special, or if you are anybody, this book is a must. I legitimately cried reading this book because of how amazing the discoveries are. Learn the dark side of an unexpectedly dramatic project, and realize that it wasn’t just a project but a race to supreme glory. Learn the name Craig Venter, or relearn the name, depending on who you are. 
<h2>John Elder Robison “Look me In the Eye”</h2>
<p>The memoirs of a man with Asperger’s syndrome and a deep look into autism and autism research throughout his life. A book that will change your views and assumptions about people with this social/developmental disorder and also amaze you on his incredible life as a savant. 
<p>
<h1>Review of books that are great</h1>
<p>
<h2>Oscar Wilde’s “A Picture of Dorian Gray”</h2>
<p>Stephen Fry’s greatest inspiration, Oscar Wilde is all the boastful and eloquent person I suspected him to be. I feel he would be an annoyance in real life but the flushed innocence, the obsessive creative, and the cynical elite he created hit the nail on the head and I wanted more. 
<h2>Charles Seife’s “Proofiness” </h2>
<p>My high school’s principal bought this book for her math nerd husband when she saw me reading it. From Tompkin’s numbers to common and obscure mathematical/logical fallacy to political electorate systems, this book trumps “Freakonomics” in real life value. Get conversation starters here and prepare to remove all skepticism and obliviousness from your life. 
<h2>Ben Goldacre’s “Bad Science”</h2>
<p>This one is popular, it is also way better than “Freakonomics”. If you read “Freakonomics” and like it but think it’s too presumptuous and a little too sensational, Bad Science brings more immediate and pressing scams to the light. It hurts a little like listening to an impassioned monologue but you walk out with an argumentative vigor like never before. It’s actually a very chill book and an easy read, a breeze to read and entertaining too. 
<h2>James D. Watson’s “The Double Helix”</h2>
<p>Read about the most influential scientists as though they were just regular people who are occasionally silly or bad at driving. Learn about life as a postdoctoral student in Cambridge, the angst involved in wanting to discover something big, and everything in between. This autobiography was unexpectedly honest and entertaining for a Nobel Laureate and living legend. 
<p>Also read: “Genes, Girls, and Gamov” and develop a friendship with Gamov. 
<h2>Amir D. Aczel’s “Entanglement”</h2>
<p>Quantum mechanics from the perspective of a mathematician. This isn’t some jaded physicist; this isn’t a book written for experts or for people who can’t handle getting their minds blown. Be prepared to know more details about every single development leading to quantum entanglement than anybody needs to know. This isn’t totally positive because I started to grow a flaming frustration whenever people misquote Schodinger’s cat analogy (especially those who think it was created to explain Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle). I know enough to not be fun at parties.  
<h2>Jonah Lehrer’s “How We Decide”</h2>
<p>It is impossible to deny the fact that this guy possesses the rare trifecta: amazing writing ability, firm grasp of concepts, and incredibly good looking. The best source of developments in psychology for everyone. 
<p>Also read “Imagination” and his other books that you may find. 
<h2>Steve Almond’s “Candy Freak”</h2>
<p>I was talking about this book with a third year business student at Princeton University when he told me he was literally learning that concept in school. I just wanted to learn about chocolate and I ended up with an incredibly deep view of small candy manufacturers in America and their struggles and virtues to survive through the crushes of major corporations like Nestle and Mars. I still learned a lot about candy too. Learn complicated topics through your favorite subject here.  
<h2>Diana Preston’s “Cleopatra and Antony”</h2>
<p>This book not only blew my mind but also had so many facts that I needed to put it down periodically to allow my brain to retain the information. The vast majority of facts I picked up from the first few chapters are so obscure that nobody believes me. I am still working through it because it is so jam packed. Cleopatra was a B0$$. 
<h2>Jay Ingram’s “The Barmaid’s Brain”</h2>
<p>Canadian and Daily Planet host, Jay Ingram seems like a regular and approachable dude despite being incredibly successful and intelligent. The facts about the brain I got from this book are also so interesting that people struggle to believe me. It isn’t just some rehash of popular quick facts, its stuff that a daily planet host finds mind blowing. Worth it. 
<h2>Jon Ronson’s “The Psychopath Test”</h2>
<p>Psych minors got nothing on you after reading this book. It also dispels a bunch of wrong information perpetuated by sensationalist serial killer stories and TV shows (Dexter, House, etc). Plus some bonus Scientology encounters. Energetic, meticulous, and incredibly entertaining read. 
<h2>Sheryl Sandberg’s “Lean In”</h2>
<p>A genius in her own right, I doubt she used a ghostwriter because it isn’t as catchy or flowy as a professional writer’s work would be. I no doubt trust in her ability and respect her voice. She was clearly hesitant to say the “wrong thing” at times which impaired readability but it made it even more human and made the problems even more realizable. There were many moments that forced their way into my conscious thinking and I truly believe this book is indispensable to women, not to mention incredibly important for men as well. 
<h2>Aziz Ainsari “Modern Romance”</h2>
<p>I assumed it was a comedic book about his failures in love so I was hesitant to read it. It turned out to be a groundbreaking and deep delve into romance and its evolution. I never even thought of this before as a subject or otherwise. I see the world differently now and I have tremendous respect for Aziz Ainsari. 
<h2>Tina Fey’s “Bossypants”</h2>
<p>Funny autobiography, didn’t learn anything but it was great to read about other women who are in a leadership role which is all too lacking. 
<p>
<h1>Review of OK books:</h1>
<p>
<h2>Daniel Goleman “Emotional Intelligence”</h2>
<p>Thick book, not a page turner. Took me over a year to get through it, didn’t retain anything after the midway point. Forgot what the point of the book was at some point. Maybe it’s just me, maybe it’s the extra small font, or maybe it’s written by a non-writer. Lots of information but I rarely ever bring up the facts learned from this book. Didn’t gain any emotional intelligence either. 
<h2>David Brooks “The Social Animal”</h2>
<p>Follow fictional Harold and Erica’s lives and throw in some studies to spice it up and make it about human behavior. The introduction was too much, he tried to subtly and expertly navigate into the sweet spot of non-fiction but I suppose his list of requirements made the book relatively bland. Neither character succeeded in resonating with anything familiar or memorable; I read it primarily out of need to finish the damn thing. 
<h2>Joe Schwarcz’s “That’s the Way the Cookie Crumbles”</h2>
<p>I don’t even remember what this book is about, it’s just a compilation of things that “is what it is” but also gives explanations as to why. After reading Ben Goldacre’s “Bad Science” this book pales in comparison. 
<h2>Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner’s “Freakonomics”</h2>
<p>It is quoted too often like it is a novelty despite the fact that everyone has read it. Despite that the message is clear, the execution is well done, its success is warranted and it does justice to honor a great economist. 
<p>
<h1>Books of little value:</h1>
<p>
<h2>Benjamin Nugent’s “American Nerd”</h2>
<p>After reading this book I figured that I can write a much better book about nerds and it would actually make sense. I have no idea what inspired Benjamin to write this but it looks like a bunch of random and unrelated stories about very niche nerd types. As a nerd, it provided zero insights and was impossible to read cover to cover.
